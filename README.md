# Awesome Weight Space Learning

Weight-space learning is a rapidly-growing area within machine learning, centered on learning functions of neural network weights. This repository is a collection of weight-space learning papers. 

It is not exhaustive and will likely never be, but feel free to open a PR if you want to see a paper listed (self-promotion is welcome ðŸ™ƒ).
